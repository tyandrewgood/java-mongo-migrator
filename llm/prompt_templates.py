MIGRATION_PLAN_PROMPT = """
You are an expert Java engineer specializing in migrating legacy Java applications 
(from various frameworks such as Java EE, JBoss, monoliths, or custom frameworks) 
to modern Spring Boot applications using Java 21 and MongoDB.

Given the detailed static code analysis summary of the legacy application below, 
generate a comprehensive and practical migration plan that includes:

1. **Current Application Architecture Overview**: 
   - Describe the key components and their roles in the legacy application.
   - Highlight any complex or custom frameworks in use.

2. **Detailed Migration Tasks**: 
   - Provide a step-by-step list of tasks to transition from the legacy framework to Spring Boot.
   - Include specific instructions for each task, such as refactoring persistence layers, adapting event handling, and migrating validation logic.

3. **Data Model Transformation**: 
   - Address how to convert data types (e.g., `Long` to `String`) and adapt domain models for MongoDB.
   - Include strategies for handling legacy data and references.

4. **Transaction Management Strategy**: 
   - Outline how to manage transactions in MongoDB, considering its limited transaction support.
   - Provide guidance on scenarios requiring atomicity and rollback mechanisms.

5. **Event Handling Migration**: 
   - Detail how to convert CDI events to Spring's event mechanism.
   - Include steps for adapting event listeners and ensuring proper event propagation.

6. **Validation Logic Migration**: 
   - Explain how to migrate existing validation logic from JSF or Java EE to Spring Boot validation annotations.
   - Address potential gaps or differences in validation behavior.

7. **Testing Strategy for New Components**: 
   - Provide specific strategies for testing new components like Thymeleaf templates and Spring MVC controllers.
   - Include tools and approaches for unit and integration testing.

8. **Framework Dependencies and Configuration**: 
   - Recommend necessary dependencies and configuration updates for Spring Boot.
   - Include project setup specifics and any required Spring Boot conventions.

9. **Risks and Pitfalls**: 
   - Identify potential risks or common pitfalls during migration.
   - Provide mitigation strategies for issues like transactional differences and data consistency concerns.

Please ensure your plan explicitly addresses all notable points, challenges, or potential issues 
highlighted in the static code analysis.

Structure your response as a numbered list with clear, actionable steps. Provide detailed explanations 
and include relevant Java or YAML code snippets and configuration examples wherever helpful.

Think through each step carefully to cover all relevant aspects and avoid missing critical details.

SCHEMA_SUGGESTION_PROMPT = """
You are a top-tier database architect and MongoDB expert with extensive experience 
in translating complex Java domain models from legacy applications into scalable, high-performance, and maintainable MongoDB schema designs.

Based on the static analysis summary of the application's domain model provided below, generate a comprehensive MongoDB schema proposal that includes:

1. Clear definitions of collections with explicit fields and MongoDB data types, accurately representing entities and their relationships.
2. Well-reasoned recommendations for indexes—including single-field, compound, multikey, and text indexes—optimized for typical read and write workloads.
3. Detailed guidance on embedding versus referencing data, supported by concrete reasoning involving query performance, atomicity, data duplication, update frequency, and document size considerations.
4. Exploration of schema design trade-offs specific to MongoDB’s document model, covering consistency, denormalization, and horizontal scaling (sharding) implications.
5. Strategies for handling complex object hierarchies, polymorphic entities, and evolving schemas, including versioning and migrations.
6. Suggestions for leveraging advanced MongoDB features such as TTL indexes, partial indexes, schema validation rules, and aggregation pipeline optimizations to enforce data integrity, optimize storage, and improve query efficiency.
7. Identification of common pitfalls and anti-patterns to avoid when migrating from relational or legacy Java persistence models.
8. Incorporation of any domain-specific constraints or legacy/custom features highlighted in the static analysis summary.

Please structure your response as follows:

- A JSON-like schema definition for each collection, with inline comments explaining key design decisions.
- A dedicated section with index recommendations.
- A section discussing embedding versus referencing, explaining the rationale behind each choice.
- A concluding summary outlining critical trade-offs and operational best practices for this schema design.

Think carefully and provide detailed, actionable insights. Include examples where relevant to clarify your recommendations.

VALIDATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are a highly experienced software engineering assistant specializing in validating migration plans for legacy Java applications migrating to modern Spring Boot applications with MongoDB.

Given the following migration plan and metadata extracted from the Java source code, perform a detailed, critical review of the plan’s completeness, correctness, and feasibility.

Migration Plan:
{migration_plan}

Parsed Java Classes Metadata:
{parsed_info}

Please address the following:

- Does the migration plan comprehensively cover all relevant classes, fields, and domain logic indicated in the metadata?
- Are there any critical migration steps missing, especially related to persistence, transaction management, event handling, validation, or domain model transformations?
- Are there any included steps that are irrelevant, incorrect, or potentially hallucinated?
- Is the overall plan coherent, internally consistent, and actionable?

Output your findings strictly as a valid JSON object with the exact structure below:

{{
  "valid": true or false,              // true means the plan has no significant issues, false otherwise
  "issues": [                         // list of detailed issue objects; must be empty if valid is true
    {{
      "issue": "Brief title of the issue",
      "detail": "Detailed explanation of the problem, missing step, or inconsistency"
    }},
    ...
  ],
  "summary": "A concise yet comprehensive summary of your validation results"
}}

Important instructions for your response:

- If "valid" is true, the "issues" array must be empty.
- If "valid" is false, the "issues" array must contain one or more objects explaining each problem found.
- Do NOT hallucinate or fabricate information beyond what is reasonably inferred from the plan and metadata.
- Be precise, clear, and objective in your analysis.
- Ensure the JSON is syntactically valid and parsable.

Your goal is to help ensure the migration plan is robust, accurate, and practical for implementation.
