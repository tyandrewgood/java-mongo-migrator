### Revised MongoDB Schema

```json
{
  "DummyEntity": {
    "_id": {
      "$oid": "ObjectId"
    },
    "id": {
      "type": "Long",
      "description": "Unique identifier for the DummyEntity."
    }
  },
  "SecuredServlet": {
    "_id": {
      "$oid": "ObjectId"
    },
    "PAGE_HEADER": {
      "type": "String",
      "description": "Header content for the secured servlet."
    },
    "PAGE_FOOTER": {
      "type": "String",
      "description": "Footer content for the secured servlet."
    }
  },
  "ProvisionedManagedSecureIT": {
    "_id": {
      "$oid": "ObjectId"
    },
    // Additional fields can be added here as needed
  },
  "RemoteSecureIT": {
    "_id": {
      "$oid": "ObjectId"
    },
    // Additional fields can be added here as needed
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Schema Design

1. **_id Field**: Each document in MongoDB automatically includes an `_id` field, which serves as a unique identifier. This is crucial for ensuring that each document can be uniquely identified and referenced.

2. **Field Definitions**:
   - For `DummyEntity`, we have included an `id` field of type `Long`, which is specified in the static analysis.
   - For `SecuredServlet`, we have included `PAGE_HEADER` and `PAGE_FOOTER` fields of type `String`, also specified in the analysis.

3. **Document Structure**: Each class is represented as a separate document type in MongoDB. This allows for flexibility in managing different entities while maintaining clear separation.

4. **Transaction Management**: While MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, it is essential to design your application logic to handle transactions appropriately, especially when dealing with related documents. Consider using MongoDB's session management to ensure atomic operations when necessary.

5. **Data Consistency**: To maintain data consistency, especially in a microservices architecture, consider implementing validation rules and using MongoDB's built-in features like change streams or triggers to react to changes in data.

6. **Future Expansion**: The schema allows for easy expansion by adding additional fields or nested documents as required by future application needs.

This revised schema should provide a solid foundation for migrating your legacy Java application to a modern Spring Boot application using MongoDB while addressing the issues identified in the static code analysis summary.
