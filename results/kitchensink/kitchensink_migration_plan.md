### Revised Migration Plan for Legacy Java Application to Spring Boot with MongoDB

#### 1. Current Application Architecture Overview
The legacy application consists of several key components:

- **Entity Classes**: `Member`, which represents a member with attributes like `id`, `name`, `email`, and `phoneNumber`.
- **Controllers**: `MemberController` handles HTTP requests related to member operations.
- **Services**: `MemberRegistration` manages member registration logic and events.
- **Repositories**: `MemberRepository` interacts with the database.
- **Event Handling**: Uses CDI events for member registration notifications.
- **Validation**: Utilizes a `Validator` for input validation.
- **Additional Classes**: Includes `MemberListProducer`, `RemoteMemberRegistrationIT`, and `MemberResourceRESTService`.
- **JAX-RS Configuration**: Includes the `JaxRsActivator` class for configuring JAX-RS resources.

The application relies heavily on Java EE technologies, including CDI, EJB, and JPA, which will need to be replaced with Spring Boot equivalents.

#### 2. Detailed Migration Tasks
1. **Set Up Spring Boot Project**:
   - Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr with dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data MongoDB, and Spring Boot Starter Validation.
   - Configure the application properties for MongoDB connection.

   ```yaml
   spring:
     data:
       mongodb:
         uri: mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name
   ```

2. **Refactor Entity Classes**:
   - Convert the `Member` class to a Spring Data MongoDB document.
   - Change the `id` type from `Long` to `String` (MongoDB ObjectId).

   ```java
   @Document(collection = "members")
   public class Member {
       @Id
       private String id; // Change from Long to String
       @NotNull
       private String name;
       @Email
       private String email;
       @Pattern(regexp = "\\d{10}")
       private String phoneNumber;
       // Getters and Setters
   }
   ```

3. **Migrate Repositories**:
   - Replace the JPA repository with a Spring Data MongoDB repository interface.

   ```java
   public interface MemberRepository extends MongoRepository<Member, String> {
       Optional<Member> findByEmail(String email);
   }
   ```

4. **Refactor Services**:
   - Convert the `MemberRegistration` service to a Spring service and replace CDI annotations with Spring annotations.
   - Remove references to `EntityManager`.

   ```java
   @Service
   public class MemberRegistration {
       private final MemberRepository memberRepository;

       @Autowired
       public MemberRegistration(MemberRepository memberRepository) {
           this.memberRepository = memberRepository;
       }

       // Registration logic here, ensuring no EntityManager references are used.
   }
   ```

5. **Migrate Controllers**:
   - Convert the `MemberController` to use Spring MVC annotations (`@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`) instead of CDI.

   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/members")
   public class MemberController {
       private final MemberRegistration memberRegistration;

       @Autowired
       public MemberController(MemberRegistration memberRegistration) {
           this.memberRegistration = memberRegistration;
       }

       // Endpoint methods here, ensuring no CDI references are used.
   }
   ```

6. **Migrate Additional Classes**:
   - Refactor the `MemberListProducer` to use Spring's dependency injection.

   ```java
   @Component
   public class MemberListProducer {
       private final MemberRepository memberRepository;

       @Autowired
       public MemberListProducer(MemberRepository memberRepository) {
           this.memberRepository = memberRepository;
       }

       public List<Member> getMembers() {
           return memberRepository.findAll();
       }
   }
   
7. **Migrate JAX-RS Configuration**:
   - Replace the `JaxRsActivator` class with a Spring configuration class that sets up REST endpoints.

   ```java
   @Configuration
   public class RestConfig {
      // Configure REST endpoints if necessary, using Spring MVC features.
      // This may include setting up exception handling or response formatting.
   }
   ```

8. **Event Handling Migration**:
   - Replace CDI event handling with Spring's application event mechanism.

   ```java
   @Component
   public class MemberEventPublisher {
       @Autowired
       private ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;

       public void publish(Member member) {
           publisher.publishEvent(new MemberRegisteredEvent(this, member));
       }
       
       @EventListener
       public void handleMemberRegistered(MemberRegisteredEvent event) {
           // Handle event here.
       }
       
       // Ensure all existing event listeners are adapted accordingly.
       
    }
   
9. **Validation Logic Migration**:
    - Ensure all custom validation logic is migrated and integrated into the new application.

    ```java
    // Include any custom validation logic as needed in the Member class or separate validator classes.
    ```

10. **Testing Strategy for New Components**:
    - Use JUnit 5 and Mockito for unit testing services and controllers.
    - Use MockMvc for integration testing of REST endpoints.

    ```java
    @SpringBootTest
    @AutoConfigureMockMvc
    public class MemberControllerTest {
        @Autowired
        private MockMvc mockMvc;

        @Test
        public void testCreateMember() throws Exception {
            // Test logic here using mockMvc.perform()
        }
    }
    ```

#### 3. Data Model Transformation
- Convert the legacy data types in the domain model to match MongoDB requirements (e.g., change `Long id` to `String id`).
- For existing data migration, write a script or use a migration tool to read from the legacy database and insert into MongoDB, ensuring data transformation and integrity checks are in place.

#### 4. Transaction Management Strategy
- MongoDB supports multi-document transactions starting from version 4.0; however, they are not as straightforward as traditional RDBMS transactions.
- For atomic operations, consider using single-document updates where possible.
- For complex scenarios requiring rollback, implement compensating transactions or use event sourcing patterns.

#### 5. Risks and Pitfalls 
- **Transactional Differences**: Be aware of how MongoDB handles transactions differently than traditional RDBMS systems; plan accordingly.
- **Data Consistency Concerns**: Ensure that data integrity is maintained during migration; consider implementing data validation checks post-migration.
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor performance after migration; optimize queries and indexes based on usage patterns.

### Conclusion 
This migration plan provides a structured approach to transitioning from a legacy Java application to a modern Spring Boot application using MongoDB. Each step is designed to address specific components of the legacy system while ensuring that best practices are followed throughout the process. Regular reviews and testing will help mitigate risks associated with the migration.
