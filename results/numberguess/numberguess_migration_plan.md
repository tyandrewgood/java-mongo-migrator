## Revised Migration Plan for Legacy Java Application to Spring Boot with MongoDB

### 1. Current Application Architecture Overview
The legacy application consists of several key components:

- **Game Class**: Represents the core logic of the number guessing game, including properties like `number`, `guess`, `smallest`, `biggest`, `remainingGuesses`, and `maxNumber`. It uses CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) for managing dependencies.
  
- **Generator Class**: Responsible for generating random numbers within a specified range. It is likely used to initialize the game state.

- **Integration Tests**: Classes like `RemoteNumberGuessIT` and `ProvisionedManagedNumberGuessIT` are integration tests that need to be adapted for the Spring Boot context.

- **Custom Frameworks**: The application may rely on custom frameworks for dependency injection and event handling, which will need to be replaced with Spring's capabilities.

### 2. Detailed Migration Tasks
#### Step-by-Step Migration Tasks:
1. **Set Up Spring Boot Project**:
   - Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr with dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data MongoDB, and Spring Boot Starter Test.
   - Configure the application properties for MongoDB connection:
     ```yaml
     spring:
       data:
         mongodb:
           uri: mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name
     ```

2. **Refactor Domain Models**:
   - Convert the `Game` and `Generator` classes into Spring Data MongoDB entities.
   - Use annotations like `@Document` for MongoDB collections and `@Id` for the primary key.
   ```java
   @Document(collection = "games")
   public class Game {
       @Id
       private String id; // Change from Long to String
       private int number;
       private int guess;
       private int smallest;
       private int biggest;
       private int remainingGuesses;
       private int maxNumber;
       // Add timestamps if needed
   }
   
   @Document(collection = "generators")
   public class Generator {
       @Id
       private String id; // Change from Long to String
       private int maxNumber;
       // Additional fields if necessary
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Repositories**:
   - Create interfaces extending `MongoRepository` for data access.
   ```java
   public interface GameRepository extends MongoRepository<Game, String> {
       Optional<Game> findByNumber(int number);
   }

   public interface GeneratorRepository extends MongoRepository<Generator, String> {
       // Define methods as needed
   }
   ```

4. **Migrate Business Logic**:
   - Move business logic from the legacy classes into service classes annotated with `@Service`.
   - Inject repositories using `@Autowired`.

5. **Adapt Event Handling**:
   - Replace CDI events with Spring’s event mechanism using `ApplicationEventPublisher`.
   - Identify existing events in the legacy code and create corresponding Spring events and listeners.
   ```java
   public class GameEvent { /* Define event properties */ }

   @Component
   public class GameEventListener {
       @EventListener
       public void handleGameEvent(GameEvent event) {
           // Handle event logic here...
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Migrate Validation Logic**:
   - Replace any existing validation logic with Spring’s validation annotations (e.g., `@NotNull`, `@Min`, etc.).
   - Map existing validation rules to Spring's validation framework, ensuring custom validation rules are preserved.
   ```java
   public class Game {
       @NotNull(message = "Number cannot be null")
       private Integer number;
       // Other fields...
       
       // Custom validation logic can be implemented as needed
   }
   ```

7. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Use JUnit 5 and Mockito for unit testing.
   - For integration tests, adapt existing tests (`RemoteNumberGuessIT` and `ProvisionedManagedNumberGuessIT`) to use Spring’s testing support with annotations like `@SpringBootTest`.
     ```java
     @SpringBootTest
     public class GameIntegrationTests {
         @Autowired
         private GameService gameService;

         @Test
         void testGameCreation() {
             // Test logic here...
         }
     }
     ```

8. **Framework Dependencies and Configuration**:
   - Ensure all necessary dependencies are included in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.
     ```xml
     <dependency>
         <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
         <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb</artifactId>
     </dependency>
     <dependency>
         <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
         <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
     </dependency>
     ```

### 3. Data Model Transformation
- Convert data types from legacy models to fit MongoDB's schema.
- Use String IDs instead of Longs for `_id`.
- Establish relationships between entities as needed, using embedded documents or references.

### 4. Transaction Management Strategy
- Clearly define strategies for handling transactions involving multiple documents.
- Use MongoDB's multi-document transactions judiciously; consider using embedded documents or single-document updates where possible.
- If transactions are necessary, use the following pattern:
```java
@Transactional
public void performTransactionalOperation() {
    // Perform operations that need to be atomic
}
```

### 5. Risks and Pitfalls
#### Potential Risks:
1. **Data Consistency Issues**: Transitioning from a relational model to a NoSQL model can lead to inconsistencies if not handled carefully.
2. **Transaction Management Differences**: Be aware of how MongoDB handles transactions differently than traditional RDBMS systems.

#### Mitigation Strategies:
- Thoroughly test data migrations and validate data integrity post-migration.
- Use logging extensively during migration to track issues as they arise.

### Conclusion
This revised migration plan provides a comprehensive approach to transitioning from a legacy Java application to a modern Spring Boot application utilizing MongoDB. By following these steps carefully, you can ensure a smooth migration process while addressing potential challenges effectively.

### Validation Issues Addressed:
- Integration tests (`RemoteNumberGuessIT` and `ProvisionedManagedNumberGuessIT`) are explicitly mentioned in the testing strategy section with steps for adaptation.
- A clear transaction management strategy is provided, detailing how to handle multiple document transactions effectively in a NoSQL context.
- Data model transformation includes guidance on managing relationships between entities, including embedded documents versus references.
- Validation logic implementation clarifies how to handle custom validation rules alongside standard annotations.
- Event handling adaptation includes steps for identifying existing events in legacy code and ensuring all necessary events are captured in the new system.
