## Revised Migration Plan for Legacy Java Application to Spring Boot with MongoDB

### 1. Current Application Architecture Overview
The legacy application consists of several key components:

- **ProvisionedManagedSecureIT**: Responsible for managing secure IT resources. Define its role and functionality for accurate migration.
- **RemoteSecureIT**: Handles remote security operations. Clarify its specific role and functionality.
- **TestAuthenticationMechanism**: Implements CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) for authentication, utilizing headers for username, password, and messages.
- **SecurityFactory**: Creates security-related objects. Identify the types of objects it creates for migration.
- **ElytronIdentityStore**: Manages user identities and security domains, using CDI for dependency injection.
- **User**: Represents user entities with attributes like username, password, and groups.
- **SecuredServlet**: Handles secured servlet operations with CDI injections for security context and identity.

### 2. Detailed Migration Tasks
#### Step-by-Step Migration Tasks:
1. **Set Up Spring Boot Project**:
   - Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr with dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data MongoDB, Spring Security, and Thymeleaf.
   - Example `pom.xml` dependencies:
     ```xml
     <dependency>
         <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
         <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb</artifactId>
     </dependency>
     <dependency>
         <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
         <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
     </dependency>
     <dependency>
         <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
         <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf</artifactId>
     </dependency>
     ```

2. **Refactor Domain Models**:
   - Convert legacy domain models to Spring Data MongoDB entities.
   - Example User entity:
     ```java
     @Document(collection = "users")
     public class User {
         @Id
         private String id; // Use String for MongoDB ObjectId
         private String userName;
         private String password; // Store hashed passwords
         private Set<String> groups;
         private Date createdAt;
         private Date updatedAt;
     }
     ```

3. **Migrate Persistence Layer**:
   - Replace legacy persistence logic with Spring Data repositories.
   - Example repository interface:
     ```java
     public interface UserRepository extends MongoRepository<User, String> {
         Optional<User> findByUserName(String userName);
     }
     ```

4. **Adapt Event Handling**:
   - Identify existing CDI events in the legacy application and create corresponding custom events extending `ApplicationEvent`.
   - Implement listeners using `@EventListener`.
   - Example of a custom event:
     ```java
     public class UserCreatedEvent extends ApplicationEvent {
         private final User user;

         public UserCreatedEvent(Object source, User user) {
             super(source);
             this.user = user;
         }

         public User getUser() {
             return user;
         }
     }
     ```
   - Ensure all necessary events from the legacy application are covered.

5. **Migrate Security Logic**:
   - Implement Spring Security configuration to replace ElytronIdentityStore and TestAuthenticationMechanism.
   - Example security configuration:
     ```java
     @Configuration
     @EnableWebSecurity
     public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
         @Override
         protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
             auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
                 .withUser("user").password(passwordEncoder().encode("password")).roles("USER");
         }

         @Bean
         public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
             return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
         }
         
         // Additional configurations may be required based on legacy security logic.
     }
     ```

6. **Migrate User Password Handling**:
   - Develop a strategy to migrate existing user passwords from the legacy system to a hashed format compatible with Spring Security.
   - Implement a migration script that retrieves existing passwords, hashes them using `BCryptPasswordEncoder`, and stores them in the new system securely.

7. **Migrate Validation Logic**:
   - Replace legacy validation annotations with Spring's `@Valid` and `@Validated`.
   - Identify any custom validation logic in the legacy application and adapt it to work within the Spring context.

8. **Implement Transaction Management**:
   - Use MongoDB's transaction support where necessary (e.g., multi-document transactions).
   - Specify scenarios requiring transactions, such as operations involving multiple related documents (e.g., creating a user with associated roles).
   - For atomic operations, consider using `@Transactional` on service methods.

9. **Testing Strategy for New Components**:
   - Use JUnit and Mockito for unit testing services and controllers.
   - Use MockMvc for testing controllers in isolation.
   - Integration tests should cover end-to-end scenarios using TestRestTemplate or WebTestClient.

10. **Framework Dependencies and Configuration**:
    - Update `application.properties` or `application.yml` for MongoDB connection settings.
    ```yaml
    spring:
        data:
            mongodb:
                uri: mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
    ```

### 3. Data Model Transformation
- Convert `Long` IDs to `String` (MongoDB ObjectId).
- Ensure all domain models are annotated with `@Document`.
- Handle legacy data migration using scripts or ETL processes to populate the new MongoDB schema.

### 4. Transaction Management Strategy
- Use MongoDB transactions for operations that require atomicity across multiple documents (e.g., user creation with associated roles).
- For single document operations, ensure that the application logic handles consistency without explicit transactions.

### 5. Risks and Pitfalls
#### Common Risks:
1. **Data Consistency Issues**: Ensure that data migrations maintain integrity; consider using versioning strategies.
2. **Transaction Limitations in MongoDB**: Be aware of the limitations of transactions in MongoDB; design your application accordingly.
3. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Monitor performance post-migration; optimize queries and indexes as needed.

#### Mitigation Strategies:
- Conduct thorough testing during migration phases to catch issues early.
- Use logging and monitoring tools to track application performance after migration.

### 6. Additional Migration Steps for Unaddressed Classes
1. **ProvisionedManagedSecureIT Migration**:
   - Define its role in managing secure IT resources within the new architecture.
   - Create a corresponding service class in Spring Boot that encapsulates its functionality.

2. **RemoteSecureIT Migration**:
   - Clarify its specific role in handling remote security operations.
   - Implement a service class that manages remote security tasks.

3. **SecurityFactory Migration**:
   - Identify the types of security-related objects it creates and refactor them into appropriate Spring components or services.

4. **TestAuthenticationMechanism Migration**:
   - Refactor this class to utilize Spring Security's authentication mechanisms instead of CDI injections.

5. **ElytronIdentityStore Migration**:
   - Migrate its functionality into a dedicated service that manages user identities within the new architecture.

6. **SecuredServlet Migration**:
   - Adapt this servlet to work within the Spring MVC framework while ensuring proper security context handling.

By following this comprehensive migration plan, you can effectively transition your legacy Java application to a modern Spring Boot architecture while leveraging MongoDB as your data store.
